Minimal reference examples for Anchor account
[constraints](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/derive.Accounts.html).

## Instruction Attribute

You can access the instruction’s arguments with the `#[instruction(..)]`
attribute. You have to list them in the same order as in the instruction but you
can omit all arguments after the last one you need.

```rust filename="Example" /bump: u8/ {7}
pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Create>, bump: u8, authority: Pubkey, data: u64) -> Result<()> {
    ...
    Ok(())
}
...
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(bump: u8)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    ...
}
```

## Normal Constraints

### `signer`

Checks the given account signed the transaction. Custom errors are supported via
@. Consider using the Signer type if you would only have this constraint on the
account.

```rust filename="Constraint" /signer/
#[account(signer)]
#[account(signer @ <custom_error>)]
```

[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/signer)

### `mut`

Checks the given account is mutable. This makes Anchor persist any state
changes. Custom errors are supported via @.

```rust filename="Constraint" /mut/
#[account(mut)]
#[account(mut @ <custom_error>)]
```

Examples:
[Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/mut)
[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/mut)

### `init`

Creates the account via a CPI to the system program and initializes it (sets its
account discriminator).

```rust filename="Constraint" /init/
#[account(
  init,
  payer = <target_account>,
  space = <num_bytes>
)]
```

Examples:
[Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/init)
[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/init)

### `init_if_needed`

Exact same functionality as the `init` constraint but only runs if the account
does not exist yet. This feature should be used with care and is therefore
behind a feature flag. You can enable it by importing anchor-lang with the
init-if-needed cargo feature. When using init_if_needed, you need to make sure
you properly protect yourself against re-initialization attacks.

```rust filename="Constraint" /init_if_needed/
#[account(
  init_if_needed,
  payer = <target_account>
)]
#[account(
  init_if_needed,
  payer = <target_account>,
  space = <num_bytes>
)]
```

[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/init_if_needed)

### `seeds, bump`

Checks that the given account is a PDA derived from the currently executing
program, the seeds, and if provided, the bump. If not provided, Anchor uses the
canonical bump. Add `seeds::program = <expr>` to derive the PDA from a different
program than the currently executing one.

```rust filename="Constraint" /seeds/1,3,5,6,8,10 /bump/
#[account(
  seeds = <seeds>,
  bump
)]
#[account(
  seeds = <seeds>,
  bump,
  seeds::program = <expr>
)]
#[account(
  seeds = <seeds>,
  bump = <expr>
)]
#[account(
  seeds = <seeds>,
  bump = <expr>,
  seeds::program = <expr>
)]
```

[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/seed-bump)

### `has_one`

Checks the `target_account` field on the account matches the key of the
`target_account` field in the Accounts struct. Custom errors are supported via
@.

```rust filename="Constraint" /has_one/
#[account(
  has_one = <target_account>
)]
#[account(
  has_one = <target_account> @ <custom_error>
)]
```

[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/has_one)

### `address`

Checks the account key matches the pubkey. Custom errors are supported via @.

```rust filename="Constraint" /address/
#[account(address = <expr>)]
#[account(address = <expr> @ <custom_error>)]
```

Examples:
[Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/address)
[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/address)

### `owner`

Checks the account owner matches `expr`. Custom errors are supported via @.

```rust filename="Constraint" /owner/
#[account(owner = <expr>)]
#[account(owner = <expr> @ <custom_error>)]
```

Examples:
[Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/owner)
[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/owner)

### `executable`

Checks the account is executable (i.e., the account is a program). You may want
to use the Program type instead.

```rust filename="Constraint" /executable/
#[account(executable)]
```

Examples:
[Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/executable)
[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/executable)

### `zero`

Checks the account discriminator is zero. Use this constraint if you want to
create an account in a previous instruction and then initialize it in your
instruction instead of using init. This is necessary for accounts that are
larger than 10 Kibibyte because those accounts cannot be created via a CPI
(which is what init would do).

```rust filename="Constraint" /zero/
#[account(zero)]
```

Examples:
[Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/zero)
[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/zero)

### `close`

Marks the account as closed at the end of the instruction’s execution (sets its
discriminator to the CLOSED_ACCOUNT_DISCRIMINATOR) and sends its lamports to the
specified account. Setting the discriminator to a special variant makes account
revival attacks (where a subsequent instruction adds the rent exemption lamports
again) impossible. Requires `mut` to exist on the account.

```rust filename="Constraint" /close/
#[account(close = <target_account>)]
```

Examples:
[Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/close)
[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/close)

### `constraint`

Constraint that checks whether the given expression evaluates to true. Use this
when no other constraint fits your use case.

```rust filename="Constraint" /constraint/
#[account(constraint = <expr>)]
#[account(
  constraint = <expr> @ <custom_error>
)]
```

[Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/constraint)
[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/constraint)

### `realloc`

Used to realloc program account space at the beginning of an instruction.

```rust filename="Constraint" /realloc/
#[account(
  realloc = <space>,
  realloc::payer = <target>,
  realloc::zero = <bool>
)]
```

[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/realloc)

## SPL Constraints

### `token`

Can be used as a check or with `init` to create a token account with the given
mint address and authority. When used as a check, it's possible to only specify
a subset of the constraints.

```rust filename="Constraint" /token/
#[account(
  token::mint = <target_account>,
  token::authority = <target_account>
)]
#[account(
  token::mint = <target_account>,
  token::authority = <target_account>,
  token::token_program = <target_account>
)]
```

Examples:
[Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/token)
[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/token)

### `mint`

Can be used as a check or with `init` to create a mint account with the given
mint decimals and mint authority. The freeze authority is optional when used
with `init`. When used as a check, it's possible to only specify a subset of the
constraints.

```rust filename="Constraint" /mint/
#[account(
  mint::authority = <target_account>,
  mint::decimals = <expr>
)]
#[account(
  mint::authority = <target_account>,
  mint::decimals = <expr>,
  mint::freeze_authority = <target_account>
)]
```

[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/mint)

### `associated_token`

Can be used as a standalone as a check or with `init` to create an associated
token account with the given mint address and authority.

```rust filename="Constraint" /associated_token/
#[account(
  associated_token::mint = <target_account>,
  associated_token::authority = <target_account>
)]
#[account(
  associated_token::mint = <target_account>,
  associated_token::authority = <target_account>,
  associated_token::token_program = <target_account>
)]
```

Examples:
[Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/associated_token)
[Github](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/associated_token)

### `token_program`

The `token_program` can optionally be overridden.

```rust filename="Constraint" /token_program/
#[account(*::token_program = <target_account>)]
```

Examples:
[Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/account-constraints/token_program)
