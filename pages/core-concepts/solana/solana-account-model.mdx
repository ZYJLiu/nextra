## Solana Account Model

### Account 

On Solana, all data is organized into what are referred to as "accounts.”
An account is simply a buffer of bytes that can be used to store arbitrary data.
Each account is identifiable by its unique address, represented as 32-bytes in the format of an Ed25519 `PublicKey`.

This relationship between the account and its address can be thought of a key-value pair, where the address serves as the key to locate the corresponding on-chain data of the account.

### AccountInfo

Every account on Solana has the following data structure known as the `AccountInfo`.

The `AccountInfo` of an account stores the following information:

- **data**: A byte array which can be used to store any arbitrary data. This is often referred to as the "account data".
- **executable**: A boolean flag that specifies if the account is an executable program.
- **lamports**: A numeric representation of the account's balance in lamports (smallest unit of SOL).
- **owner**: Identifies the program authorized to modify the account data.

To store data on-chain, an certain amount of SOL must be transferred to an account. The amount is proportional to the size of data stored on the account.
This concept is commonly referred to as “rent”.
However, you can think of "rent" more like a "deposit" because the SOL allocated to an account can be fully recovered when the account is closed.

As a key part of the Solana Account Model, every account on Solana has a designated "owner", specifically a program.
This program, and only this program, can modify the data stored on the account.

  Only the program designated as the owner of an account can modify the data stored on the account.
  With the exception of adding SOL (increasing lamport balance), which can be done by any account.

### System Program

By default, all new accounts are owned by the System Program.
The System Program is one of Solana's "Native Programs", which performs several key tasks such as:

- **New Account Creation**: Only the System Program can create new accounts.
- **Space Allocation**: Sets the byte capacity for each account, which specifies the amount of data that can be stored on an account and determines the amount of SOL that must be allocated for “rent”.
- **Assign Ownership**: Once the System Program creates an account, it can reassign the designated program owner to a different program account.
    This is how custom programs take ownership of new accounts created by the System Program.

For instance, what we often call a "wallet" is an account owned by the System Program, where the executable flag of the account is set to false, indicating the account is not an executable program.

  Note that only System Program owned accounts can be transaction fee payers.

### Program Account

On Solana, “smart contracts” are referred to as programs. A program is an account with its “executable” flag set to true.
Programs themselves are owned by the BPF Loader program, another one of Solana's “Native Programs”. 
At a high-level, the BPF Loader program is simply the program that owns all other programs (other than Native Programs).

When a new program is deployed on Solana, technically two separate accounts are created.

- **Program Account**: The primary account representing the program and stores the address of the executable data account.
- **Program Executable Data Account**: Dedicated to storing the executable byte code of the program.

However, for simplicity, you can think of the "Program Account" as synonymous with the program itself.

Note that when we say "program," we're referring to the "Program Account". The address of the "Program Account" is commonly referred to as the “program ID”.

### Data Account

Solana's programs are "stateless", meaning that program accounts only store the program's executable byte code.
To store and modify additional data, new accounts must be created.
These accounts are commonly referred to as “data accounts”.

For data accounts, the “executable” flag is set to false and the AccountInfo's data field can be used to store arbitrary data as defined by a program.

![Data Account](/solana/account-model/data-account.png)

Recall that only the System Program can create new accounts.
Once the System Program creates an account, it can then transfer ownership of the new account to another program.
In other words, creating a data account for a custom program requires two steps:

1. Invoke the System Program to create an account, which then transfer ownership to a custom program
2. Invoke the custom program, which now owns the account, to then initialize the account data as defined in the program logic

Note that this is often abstracted as a single step. However, it's important to understand the underlying process.
