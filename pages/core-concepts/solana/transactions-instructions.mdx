## Transactions and Instructions

### Transaction

On Solana, transactions are sent to interact with the network from the client. 
Letâ€™s begin by expanding on the details that make up a transaction:

1. **Message:** At its core, a transaction has a message. This message includes:
   - **Instructions**: An array of instructions to be executed.
   - **Recent Blockhash**: Acts as a timestamp for the transaction.
   - **Feepayer**: Specifies the transaction fee payer.
2. **Signers:** An array of signers included on the transaction.

<Callout>
 By default, the first signer on the transaction is set as the fee payer unless otherwise specified.
</Callout>

For simplicity, a transaction can be thought of a request to process one or multiple instructions.

Instructions in a transaction are processed sequentially, in the order they are added to a transaction.
Transactions are also processed "atomically", meaning that all instructions in a transaction either process successfully or, if one fails, the entire transaction is rejected.

### Instruction

An instruction is a request for a program to perform a specific operation and is the smallest contiguous unit of execution logic in a program. 

Each instruction in a transaction must include 3 pieces of information:

- **Program address**: Specifies the program being invoked
- **Accounts**: Lists every account the instruction reads from or writes to, including other programs
- **Instruction Data**: Specifies which instruction on the program to invoke, plus any additional data required by the instruction

![Instruction](/solana/transaction-instruction/instruction.png)

For every account required by an instruction, the following information must be specified:

- **Account address**: The on-chain address of an account
- **is_signer**: Specify if the account is required as a signer on the transaction
- **is_writable**: Specify if the account data will be modified

This information is referred to as the `AccountMeta`.

By clearly identifying the accounts required by an instruction and specifying whether each account is writable, transaction processing can be parallelized.
This means that if two transactions do not include any accounts which write to the same state, then the transactions can be executed at the same time.

### SOL Transfer Example

Below is a diagram representing a transaction with a single instruction to transfer SOL from a sender to a receiver.

![SOL Transfer](/solana/transaction-instruction/sol-transfer.png)

Once the transaction is sent, the System Program is invoked to process the transfer instruction.
The System Program then updates the lamport balances of both the sender and receiver accounts accordingly.

Here is [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/656a0ea7fb53fa325bfd0c3e) example of how to build a SOL transfer instruction using the `SystemProgram.transfer` method:

```typescript filename="SOL Transfer" showLineNumbers {5-9}
// Define the amount to transfer
const transferAmount = 0.01; // 0.01 SOL

// Create a transfer instruction for transferring SOL from wallet_1 to wallet_2
const transferInstruction = SystemProgram.transfer({
  fromPubkey: sender.publicKey,
  toPubkey: receiver.publicKey,
  lamports: transferAmount * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL, // Convert transferAmount to lamports
});

// Add the transfer instruction to a new transaction
const transaction = new Transaction().add(transferInstruction);
```

Here is a [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/656a102efb53fa325bfd0c3f) example of how to manually built the same SOL transfer instruction:

```typescript filename="SOL Transfer" showLineNumbers /instructionData/1,4 {15-22}
// Define the amount to transfer
const transferAmount = 0.01; // 0.01 SOL

// Instruction index for the SystemProgram transfer instruction
const transferInstructionIndex = 2;

// Create a buffer for the data to be passed to the transfer instruction
const instructionData = Buffer.alloc(4 + 8); // uint32 + uint64
// Write the instruction index to the buffer
instructionData.writeUInt32LE(transferInstructionIndex, 0);
// Write the transfer amount to the buffer
instructionData.writeBigUInt64LE(BigInt(transferAmount * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL), 4);

// Manually create a transfer instruction for transferring SOL from sender to receiver
const transferInstruction = new TransactionInstruction({
  keys: [
    { pubkey: sender.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true },
    { pubkey: receiver.publicKey, isSigner: false, isWritable: true },
  ],
  programId: SystemProgram.programId,
  data: instructionData,
});

// Add the transfer instruction to a new transaction
const transaction = new Transaction().add(transferInstruction);
```

Under the hood, the `SystemProgram.transfer` method is functionally equivalent to the more verbose example above.
It is simply abstracting away the details of creating the instruction data buffer and explicitly specifying the `AccountMeta` for each account required by the instruction.

Note that the details for building specific program instructions are often abstracted away by client libraries and frameworks like Anchor.
However, it is helpful to understand the underlying structure of transactions and instructions.
