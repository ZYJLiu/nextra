## Tokens on Solana

### Token Program

Next, let's go over the basics of the [Token Program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/program) to better understand how tokens are represented on Solana.
On Solana, the Token Program stores all the instruction logic for interacting with tokens on the network (both fungible and non-fungible).

![Token Program](/solana/token/token-program.png)

All tokens on Solana are effectively data accounts owned by the Token Program.
Tokens (other than native SOL) are referred to as SPL Tokens, where SPL stands for [Solana Program Library](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library).

### Mint Account

Tokens on Solana are uniquely identified by the address of a “Mint Account” owned by the Token Program.
This account is effectively a global counter for a specific token, and stores data such as:

- Supply: Total supply of the token
- Decimals: Decimal precision of the token
- Mint authority: The account authorized to create new units of the token, and thus increasing the supply
- Freeze authority: The account authorized to freeze tokens from being transferred from "token accounts"

Here is a Solana Explorer link to the USDC [Mint Account](https://explorer.solana.com/address/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v)
which stores this [data](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/state.rs#L18-L32).

```rust
pub struct Mint {
    /// Optional authority used to mint new tokens. The mint authority may only
    /// be provided during mint creation. If no mint authority is present
    /// then the mint has a fixed supply and no further tokens may be
    /// minted.
    pub mint_authority: COption<Pubkey>,
    /// Total supply of tokens.
    pub supply: u64,
    /// Number of base 10 digits to the right of the decimal place.
    pub decimals: u8,
    /// Is `true` if this structure has been initialized
    pub is_initialized: bool,
    /// Optional authority to freeze token accounts.
    pub freeze_authority: COption<Pubkey>,
}
```

### Token Account

To hold units of a specific token, another type of data account owned by the Token Program must be created.
This account is referred to as a "Token Account".

The Token Account stores data including the following:

- Mint: The type of token the Token Account holds units of
- Owner: The account authorized to transfer tokens out of the Token Account
- Amount: Units of the token the Token Account currently holds

![Token Account](/solana/token/token-account.png)

Note that each Token Account's data includes an “owner" field used to identify who has authority over that specific Token Account. This is separate from the program owner specified in the AccountInfo, which is the Token Program for all Token Accounts.

For a wallet to hold units of a certain token, it needs to create a token account for a specific type of token (mint) that designates the wallet as the owner of the token account.
A wallet can create multiple token accounts for the same type of token, but each token account can only be owned by one wallet and hold units of one type of token.

Here a Solana Explorer link to a USDC [Token Account](https://explorer.solana.com/address/3emsAVdmGKERbHjmGfQ6oZ1e35dkf5iYcS6U4CPKFVaa)
with this [owner](https://explorer.solana.com/address/7VHUFJHWu2CuExkJcJrzhQPJ2oygupTWkL2A2For4BmE)
which stores this [data](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/state.rs#L89-L110).

```rust
pub struct Account {
    /// The mint associated with this account
    pub mint: Pubkey,
    /// The owner of this account.
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    /// The amount of tokens this account holds.
    pub amount: u64,
    /// If `delegate` is `Some` then `delegated_amount` represents
    /// the amount authorized by the delegate
    pub delegate: COption<Pubkey>,
    /// The account's state
    pub state: AccountState,
    /// If is_native.is_some, this is a native token, and the value logs the
    /// rent-exempt reserve. An Account is required to be rent-exempt, so
    /// the value is used by the Processor to ensure that wrapped SOL
    /// accounts do not drop below this threshold.
    pub is_native: COption<u64>,
    /// The amount delegated
    pub delegated_amount: u64,
    /// Optional authority to close the account.
    pub close_authority: COption<Pubkey>,
}
```

### Associated Token Account

To simplify the process of locating a token account's address for a specific mint and owner, we often use Associated Token Accounts.
It's important to understand that an Associated Token Account isn't a different type of token account; it's just a token account with a specific address.

An Associated Token Account is a token account whose address is deterministically derived using the owner's address and the mint account's address.

![Associated Token Account](/solana/token/associated-token-account.png)

This introduces a key concept in Solana development: Program Derived Address (PDA).
Conceptually, a PDA provide a deterministic way to generate an address using some predefined inputs.
This enables us to easily find the address of an account at a later time.

Here is an [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/656a2dd0fb53fa325bfd0c41) example that derives the USDC Associated Token Account address an owner.
It will always generate the [same address](https://explorer.solana.com/address/4kokFKCFMxpCpG41yLYkLEqXW8g1WPfCt2NC9KGivY6N) for the same mint and owner.

```typescript showLineNumbers
const associatedTokenAccountAddress = getAssociatedTokenAddressSync(
  USDC_MINT_ADDRESS,
  OWNER_ADDRESS
);
```

Specifically, the address for an Associated Token Account is derived using the following inputs.
Here is an [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/656a31d0fb53fa325bfd0c42) example that generates the same address as the previous example.

```typescript showLineNumbers
const [PDA, bump] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [
    OWNER_ADDRESS.toBuffer(),
    TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID.toBuffer(),
    USDC_MINT_ADDRESS.toBuffer(),
  ],
  ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
);
```

If two wallets want to hold units of the same type of token, each wallet needs its own token account for the specific mint account.
You can think of the associated token account as the "default" token account for a specific mint and owner.

### Metadata Account

Token metadata, such as name and image, are not directly supported by the Token Program. 
Instead, the [Metaplex Token Metadata Program](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata) is used to create an additional on-chain account called the "Token Metadata Account" to associate additional metadata to a Mint Account.
You can refer to the [Metaplex documentation](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/overview) to better understand the relationship between various accounts.
