## Getting Started with Anchor

This section provides a basic step-by-step guide to create, build, and test your
project using Anchor.  
Ensure you've completed the required [installations](installation) before
proceeding.

<Steps>

### Initialize the Project

To start, you need to initialize your project. Replace `[project-name]` with
your desired project name. This command creates a new Anchor project with the
specified name.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
anchor init [project-name]
```

Once the project is initialized, change your current directory to the newly
created project folder and open it in your code editor.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
cd [project-name]
```

### Build the Program

With your project set up, the next step is to build it. This process compiles
your program and prepares it for deployment or testing. If this is your first
time building the program, it will generate a `/target` folder with various
subfolders related to your program.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
anchor build
```

### Test the Program

Finally, to verify that everything is working as expected, run the tests for
your project.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
anchor test
```

By default, the `Anchor.toml` config file specify the cluster to `localnet`.
When you run the `anchor test` command, it will automatically:

1. Start a local Solana validator
2. Build and deploy your program to the local cluster
3. Run the tests in the `tests` folder
4. Stop the local Solana validator

Alternatively, you can manually start a local Solana validator and run tests
against it. This is useful if you want to keep the validator running while you
iterate on your program. It allows you to inspect accounts and transaction logs
on the [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=custom).

First, open a new terminal and start a local Solana validator.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
solana-test-validator
```

With the validator running, return to the original terminal and deploy the
program to the local cluster.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
anchor deploy
```

Finally, run the tests against the local cluster. Use the
`--skip-local-validator` flag to skip starting the local validator since it's
already running.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
anchor test --skip-local-validator
```

</Steps>

## Project File Structure

Upon creating a new Anchor workspace, a structured directory is set up with
several important files and folders.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name=".anchor">
    <FileTree.File name="program-logs" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" />
  <FileTree.Folder name="migrations" />
  <FileTree.Folder name="programs" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="lib.rs" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="Cargo.toml" />
    <FileTree.File name="Xargo.toml" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="target">
    <FileTree.Folder name="deploy">
      <FileTree.File name="[project-name]-keypair.json" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="idl">
      <FileTree.File name="[project-name].json" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="types">
      <FileTree.File name="[project-name].ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="tests">
    <FileTree.File name="[project-name].ts" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="Anchor.toml" />
  <FileTree.File name="Cargo.toml" />
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
</FileTree>

Below is an overview of the key files in the workspace:

### Programs Folder

The programs folder contains your project's Anchor programs. Each program is a
subfolder containing a `Cargo.toml` file and a `src` folder with a `lib.rs`
file. The `lib.rs` file contains the program's code, while the `Cargo.toml` file
contains the program's dependencies.

### Tests Folder

The tests folder contains test files for your project. A default test file is
created for you when you initialize your project.

### Target Folder

The target folder contains the compiled output of your project. It includes the
following subfolders:

- **deploy**: Contains the keypair for your program.
- **idl**: Contains the JSON IDL for your program.
- **types**: Contains the TypeScript version of your program's IDL.

### Anchor.toml File

The [`Anchor.toml`](/references/anchor-toml) file configures workspace-wide
settings for your programs.

### .anchor Folder

Includes a `program-logs` file that contains the program's transaction logs from
last run of test files in the `tests` folder.

### App Folder

The app folder is an empty folder that can be optionally used for your frontend
code (if you're using a monorepo structure).
