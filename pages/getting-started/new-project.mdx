## Getting Started with Anchor

This section provides a basic step-by-step guide to create, build, and test your project using Anchor.  
Ensure you've completed the required [installations](installation) before proceeding.

<Steps>

### Initialize the Project

To start, you need to initialize your project. Replace `[project-name]` with your desired project name.
This command creates a new Anchor project with the specified name.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
anchor init [project-name]
```

Once the project is initialized, change your current directory to the newly created project folder:

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
cd [project-name]
```

### Build the Program

With your project set up, the next step is to build it.
This process compiles your program and prepares it for deployment or testing.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
anchor build
```

### Test the Program

Finally, to verify that everything is working as expected, run the tests for your project:

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
anchor test
```

</Steps>

## Project File Structure

Upon creating a new Anchor workspace, a structured directory is set up with several important files and folders.

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name=".anchor">
        <FileTree.File name="program-logs" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="app"/>
    <FileTree.Folder name="migrations" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="programs" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="lib.rs" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.File name="Cargo.toml" />
        <FileTree.File name="Xargo.toml" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="target">
        <FileTree.Folder name="deploy">
            <FileTree.File name="[project-name]-keypair.json" /> 
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="idl">
            <FileTree.File name="[project-name].json" /> 
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="types">
            <FileTree.File name="[project-name].ts" /> 
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="tests">
        <FileTree.File name="[project-name].ts" /> 
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="Anchor.toml" /> 
    <FileTree.File name="Cargo.toml" /> 
    <FileTree.File name="package.json" /> 
</FileTree>

Below is an overview of the key files in the workspace:

### Programs Folder

The programs folder contains your project's Anchor programs. Each program is a subfolder containing a `Cargo.toml` file and a `src` folder with a `lib.rs` file.
The `lib.rs` file contains the program's code, while the `Cargo.toml` file contains the program's dependencies.

### Tests Folder

The tests folder contains test files for your project. Each test is a `.ts` file that contains a test suite for a program.

### Target Folder

The target folder contains the compiled output of your project. It includes the following subfolders:

- **deploy**: Contains the keypair for your program.
- **idl**: Contains the IDL for your program.
- **types**: Contains the TypeScript version of your program's IDL.

### Anchor.toml File

The [`Anchor.toml`]() file configures workspace-wide settings for your programs.

### .anchor Folder

Includes a `program-logs` file that contains the program's transaction logs from last run of test files in the `tests` folder.

### App Folder

The app folder is an empty folder designated for your frontend code (if you're using a monorepo structure).
