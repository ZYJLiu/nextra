import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## Prequisites

Begin by installing the following dependencies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

We recommend reading chapters 1-9 of the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) which cover the basics of using Rust. Most of the time you don't need advanced Rust to write anchor programs.

<Callout>
  If you are using a Windows machine, you must first install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).  
  Next, install [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). All prerequisite dependencies should then be installed using the Linux terminal.

## Install Solana

Install the [Solana CLI Tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) and then run `solana-keygen new` to create a local keypair at the default location.

By default, Anchor uses this local keypair to run your program tests.

    We also recommend checking out the official [Solana developers page](https://solana.com/developers).

## Install Anchor

### Anchor Version Manager (recommended)

Anchor version manager (avm) is a tool for using multiple versions of the anchor-cli. It will require the same dependencies as building from source. It is recommended you uninstall the NPM package if you have it installed.

Install `avm` using Cargo. Note this will replace your `anchor` binary if you had one installed.

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked --force
```

On Linux systems you may need to install additional dependencies if cargo install fails. E.g. on Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config build-essential libudev-dev libssl-dev
```

Install the latest version of the CLI using `avm`, and then set it to be the version to use.

```shell
avm install latest
avm use latest
```

Verify the installation.

```shell
anchor --version
```

### Prebuilt Binaries

Anchor binaries are available via an NPM package [`@coral-xyz/anchor-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coral-xyz/anchor-cli). 
Only `x86_64` Linux is supported currently, you must build from source for other OS'.

### Build from source

We can also use Cargo to install the CLI directly. Make sure that the `--tag` argument uses the version you want (the version here is just an example).

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor --tag v0.29.0 anchor-cli --locked
```

On Linux systems you may need to install additional dependencies if cargo install fails. On Ubuntu,

```shell
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config build-essential libudev-dev
```

Now verify the CLI is installed properly.

```shell
anchor --version
```
